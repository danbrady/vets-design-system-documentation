# Monthly Analytics Reports

This feature allows you to automatically process and display your monthly Google Looker Studio reports on the VA Design System metrics dashboard.

## âœ¨ What's New

The metrics dashboard now includes a **"Monthly Analytics Reports"** section that displays your Top 25 pages reports as interactive images that can be clicked to view full-size.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### One-Time Setup

Install required dependencies:
```bash
brew install imagemagick ghostscript
```

### Monthly Workflow

Each time you receive a new report:

1. **Save the PDF** from Google Looker Studio to your computer
2. **Run the processing command:**
   ```bash
   # Using helper script (recommended)
   ./scripts/add-monthly-report.sh path/to/your-report.pdf 2025-06
   
   # Or using npm script
   npm run process-monthly-report path/to/your-report.pdf 2025-06
   
   # Or run directly
   node scripts/process-monthly-report.js path/to/your-report.pdf 2025-06
   ```
3. **Commit and push** the changes to update the live dashboard

### Example

```bash
# Process June 2025 report
./scripts/add-monthly-report.sh ~/Downloads/VA_Design_System_Top_25_June_2025.pdf 2025-06

# Process July 2025 report  
npm run process-monthly-report ~/Downloads/VA_Design_System_Top_25_July_2025.pdf 2025-07
```

**Important:** Use the correct `YYYY-MM` format (e.g., 2025-06 for June 2025, 2025-07 for July 2025, etc.)

## How It Works

1. **PDF Processing**: The script converts your PDF to a high-quality PNG image
2. **Automatic Integration**: The image is automatically added to the dashboard and tracked in the system
3. **Responsive Display**: Reports are displayed in a responsive grid that works on all devices
4. **Modal Viewing**: Click any report to view it full-size

## What the Script Does

The `process-monthly-report.js` script:

1. **Converts PDF to PNG** at 300 DPI for crisp display
2. **Saves the image** to `src/assets/img/metrics/looker-report-YYYY-MM.png`
3. **Updates the data file** at `src/assets/data/metrics/monthly-reports.json`
4. **Provides confirmation** that everything was processed correctly

## Dashboard Features

- **Grid Layout**: Shows the 6 most recent reports in a clean grid
- **Smart Naming**: Automatically formats dates (e.g., "June 2025")
- **Click to Zoom**: Full-screen modal view with easy navigation
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- **Auto-Loading**: No manual updates needed - reports appear automatically

## File Structure

```
src/assets/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/metrics/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ monthly-reports.json          # Tracks all reports metadata
â””â”€â”€ img/metrics/
    â”œâ”€â”€ looker-report-2025-06.png     # June 2025 report
    â”œâ”€â”€ looker-report-2025-07.png     # July 2025 report
    â””â”€â”€ ...                           # Additional monthly reports
```

## Advanced Usage

### Auto-detect Current Month
The script can auto-detect the current month if you don't specify:
```bash
npm run process-monthly-report path/to/report.pdf
# Uses current year-month automatically
```

### Batch Processing
Process multiple months at once:
```bash
npm run process-monthly-report reports/june.pdf 2025-06
npm run process-monthly-report reports/july.pdf 2025-07
npm run process-monthly-report reports/august.pdf 2025-08
```

### Replacing Reports
If you need to update a report for a specific month, just run the script again with the same date:
```bash
npm run process-monthly-report updated-june-report.pdf 2025-06
# Replaces the existing June 2025 report
```

## Technical Details

### Image Quality
- **Resolution**: 300 DPI for crisp display
- **Format**: PNG for lossless quality and transparency support
- **Compression**: Optimized for web delivery while maintaining readability

### Data Management
- **Retention**: System keeps metadata for the 12 most recent reports
- **Storage**: Image files remain in the repository indefinitely
- **Performance**: Images are lazy-loaded for faster page performance

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Full feature support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Mobile Devices**: Touch-friendly modal interactions
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"ImageMagick not found"**
```bash
brew install imagemagick ghostscript
```

**"Permission denied"**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/process-monthly-report.js
chmod +x scripts/add-monthly-report.sh
```

**Reports not appearing**
1. Check the PNG was created: `ls src/assets/img/metrics/`
2. Verify JSON was updated: `cat src/assets/data/metrics/monthly-reports.json`
3. Clear browser cache and reload

**Low image quality**
The script uses 300 DPI by default. For higher quality, edit the script and change `-density 300` to `-density 600`.

### Advanced Debugging

View processing details:
```bash
# Check file sizes
ls -lh src/assets/img/metrics/

# Verify dependencies
magick -version
gs -version
```

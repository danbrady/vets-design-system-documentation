* How do you build complex, multi-part web forms?
* How do you provide navigational context?
* How do you handle progressive disclosure?

All of the patterns in this section show or cite examples from VA.gov and were researched, designed, developed, and tested by teams creating applications on our platform.

For guidance on implementing patterns in multi-step form flows, see [Form templates]({{ site.baseurl }}/templates/forms/) and [Form accessibility guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/templates/forms/accessibility-guidelines).

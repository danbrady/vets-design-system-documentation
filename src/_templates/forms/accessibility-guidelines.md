## Why form accessibility matters

Forms are often the primary way Veterans interact with VA services—from applying for benefits to updating personal information to accessing healthcare. When forms aren't accessible, they create barriers that can prevent Veterans from getting the benefits and services they've earned.

### Our commitment to inclusion

VA is committed to providing equal access to all Veterans, including the millions of Veterans with disabilities. This includes:

- 1 in 4 Veterans who live with a service-connected disability
- Veterans who use screen readers, voice recognition software, or other assistive technologies
- Veterans with cognitive disabilities, traumatic brain injuries, or conditions that affect memory and concentration
- Veterans with temporary impairments from injuries or medical treatments

### The impact of inaccessible forms

When forms aren't properly designed for accessibility, they can:

- **Prevent Veterans from applying for benefits** they need and deserve
- **Create frustration and abandonment** when users can't complete necessary tasks
- **Increase call center volume** as users seek alternative ways to complete forms
- **Violate federal accessibility requirements** under Section 508 and the Americans with Disabilities Act

### Our approach to accessible forms

These guidelines ensure that VA.gov forms work for everyone by addressing:

- **Technical accessibility**: Proper markup, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Cognitive accessibility**: Clear language, logical flow, and memory aids like automatic saving
- **Usability for all**: Designs that benefit everyone, not just users with disabilities

Every form interaction should be straightforward, regardless of how a Veteran accesses our services. Following these guidelines helps create forms that are not only compliant with accessibility standards, but truly usable by all Veterans.

## Managing focus in form flows

Digitized forms on VA.gov are built as single-page applications (SPAs). When users move to a new page in these forms (also called a “route change" in SPAs) the appcsx must manually set focus. This is because, unlike when a static page loads, focus does not reset automatically after an SPA route change. Setting focus helps users stay oriented and take the next step. 

### Why moving focus in a form application matters

* **Moving focus gives users context:** Because screen readers prioritize announcing newly focused elements, screen reader users will hear the focused element right away.
* **Managing focus moves users closer to the next relevant action:** Moving focus to the beginning of the new content helps users more easily find relevant information and the next action they need to complete.
* Meets WCAG AA criteria: Supports focus order and visibility (WCAG 2.2: [2.4.3 Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order.html), 2.4.7 [2.4.7 Focus Not Obscured](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-not-obscured.html) (AA)) and reduces unexpected context changes ([3.2.3 Consistent Navigation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/consistent-navigation.html)).

### Where to move focus when a new form page loads

When a new page loads in a form application, move focus to an element that gives users context and helps them find the next action. Use these guidelines to choose the best focus location:

1. **If the page has a unique page heading** (usually an H1 at the top of the page or H3 inside the step content), set focus there.
2. **If the page does not have a unique page heading**, set focus on the step indicator header (usually an H2). 

### Where to move focus in other scenarios 

* **If there’s a validation error when submitting, move focus to the first error message.** After the user fixes the error and submits the form successfully, follow the guidance for  [moving focus when a new page loads](#where-to-move-focus-when-a-new-form-page-loads).
* **When users navigate back to a form page**, treat it like a fresh page load and move focus to the top unique heading.
* **After a modal closes**, focus should return to the button that opened it.
* **Do not remove the “Skip to content” link on the page.** Scripts should still set focus to the top unique heading when a new page loads.
* **Scroll focused headings into view.** This helps users know where they are and meets WCAG criterion [2.4.11 (AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-not-obscured-minimum.html): Focus not obscured.

### How to set focus with forms code

Older forms use [built-in focus management](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/platform/forms-system/src/js/containers/FormPage.jsx) that moves focus to the segmented progress bar.

Newer forms use unique H3 headings for each page, and developers can set focus to these by updating their form configuration in `config/form.js.`

```javascript
// In your form configuration (config/form.js)
{
  useCustomScrollAndFocus: true,
  scrollAndFocusTarget: focusH3, // custom function to scroll and focus
}
```

### Implementation resources

* [VA Forms Library - Form Config documentation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/va-forms-library-form-config-options)
* [Live example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/cd6abe02fc9df6dea2254fa4cc9e9867deb3ce6c/src/applications/appeals/10182/config/form.js#L107-L108)

### Testing checklist

1. After clicking **Continue**, does focus land on the unique heading?
2. Is the focused item visible?
3. With a screen reader, do you immediately hear the step or page name?
4. On validation errors, does focus land on the first error message?
5. Can you use the Tab key to move forward and backward from the heading naturally?

## Form labeling and structure

Proper form structure is essential for multi-step form flows where users navigate between different questions and sections.

### Fieldsets and legends in form flows

For complete technical guidance on fieldsets and legends, see [Fieldsets, legends, and labels]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/form/#fieldsets-legends-and-labels).

#### Form-flow-specific considerations

* **Consistent grouping patterns**: Use the same fieldset/legend approach across all steps in your form
* **Progress context**: When fieldsets span multiple pages, ensure users understand the relationship between steps
* **Navigation impact**: Consider how fieldsets affect focus management when moving between form steps

### Multi-step form structure

* **Page-level headings**: Each form step should have a unique H3 that describes the current step
* **Progress indication**: Use [Progress bar - Segmented]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/form/progress-bar-segmented) to show form completion status
* **Consistent navigation**: Maintain the same button placement and wording across form steps

### Hint text and help content

* Keep essential instructions visible rather than hidden in expandable sections
* Use [Additional info]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/additional-info) components sparingly to avoid cognitive overload
* Consider how hint text affects the overall form flow and completion time

For technical implementation of hint text, see [Hint text guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/form/#hint-text).

## Input validation and error handling

Multi-step forms require special consideration for error handling to maintain user context and prevent data loss.

### Form-flow error patterns

For technical implementation of individual field errors, see [Error handling]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/form/#error-handling).

#### Error timing in form flows

* **Step-level validation**: Validate required fields when users attempt to continue to the next step
* **Final validation**: Perform comprehensive validation on the review page before submission

#### Focus management with errors

* **Single error**: Move focus to the field with the error
* **Multiple errors**: Move focus to the first field with an error or to an error summary
* **After error correction**: When users fix errors and continue, resume normal focus management for the next step

#### Error recovery in multi-step forms

* **Preserve progress**: Never lose user data when validation errors occur
* **Clear next steps**: Always tell users exactly what they need to do to continue
* **Context preservation**: Help users understand which step the error occurred on

### Error message content standards

Follow VA standards for error messaging:

* **Be specific**: "Enter a valid 9-digit Social Security number" not "Invalid input"
* **Be helpful**: Explain what the user should do to fix the error
* **Use plain language**: Avoid technical jargon
* **Stay positive**: "Enter your phone number" instead of "Don't leave this field blank"

For comprehensive error message guidance, see [Error messages]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/error-messages/).

## Cognitive accessibility

Forms must support users with cognitive disabilities, memory issues, and attention challenges.

### Memory and comprehension support

* **One question per page**: Reduce cognitive load by focusing on single tasks
* **Clear progress indication**: Help users understand where they are in the process
* **Consistent language**: Use the same terms throughout the form (follow [VA.gov word list]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/word-list))
* **Context preservation**: Remind users of key information when relevant

### Error prevention

* **Clear instructions**: Explain what information is needed before asking for it
* **Format examples**: Show expected formats for phone numbers, dates, etc.
* **Confirmation steps**: Include review pages for important submissions
* **Recovery guidance**: Provide clear next steps when errors occur

## Comprehensive accessibility testing

For complete testing methodology guidance, see [Accessibility testing for design system components]({{ site.baseurl }}/accessibility/accessibility-testing-for-design-system-components).

- **Keyboard navigation**: Navigate through the entire form using only the keyboard
- **Screen reader testing**: Test with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver to ensure all information is announced clearly
- **Error handling**: Verify that error messages are clearly associated with the relevant form fields
- **Form labels**: Confirm all form fields have proper labels and instructions
- **Color contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast ratios for all text and interface elements

### Form structure testing

- **Multi-step navigation**: Verify screen readers announce step changes and progress through the form
- **Consistent structure**: Test that fieldset and legend patterns work consistently across all form steps
- **Progress indication**: Confirm progress bar updates are announced to screen readers

### Error handling testing

- **Error recovery**: Test that focus moves appropriately after users fix validation errors  
- **Form persistence**: Verify that fixing errors doesn't cause loss of data in other form sections
- **Error announcements**: Confirm error messages are announced in the context of the current form step

### Cognitive accessibility testing

- **Save progress verification**: Confirm forms save automatically and users receive appropriate feedback
- **Session persistence**: Test that authenticated users can leave and return to forms without losing progress
- **Clear navigation**: Verify users can understand their progress through multi-step forms

For guidance on what content should be announced to screen readers, see [When a screen reader needs to announce content]({{ site.baseurl }}/accessibility/when-a-screen-reader-needs-to-announce-content).

## VA accessibility requirements and processes

All VA.gov forms must meet [VA.gov Experience Standards]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/experience-standards), which include comprehensive accessibility requirements. For a complete overview of VA's accessibility approach, see [Accessibility overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/accessibility/).

### Foundational accessibility testing

Before launching any form on VA.gov, teams must complete foundational accessibility testing as part of the collaboration cycle. This testing is required for staging review and includes:

- Color and color contrast evaluation
- Automated testing with aXe DevTools
- Content zoom and reflow testing  
- Keyboard navigation testing

[Learn more about foundational accessibility testing requirements](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/prepare-for-an-accessibility-staging-review) and how to prepare for your staging review.

### Working with the ADE team

The Accessibility Digital Experience (ADE) team provides early accessibility guidance to help teams build accessible forms from the start. Reach out to the ADE team during your planning phase rather than waiting until staging review.

When working with designers, refer to [Accessibility annotations]({{ site.baseurl }}/accessibility/accessibility-annotations) to understand how accessibility requirements are communicated from design to development.

## WCAG requirements

Forms must follow the four principles of accessibility (POUR: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust). For detailed testing methodology based on these principles, see [Accessibility testing principles]({{ site.baseurl }}/accessibility/accessibility-testing-for-design-system-components#testing-principles).

### Relevant WCAG 2.2 success criteria

* **2.4.3 Focus Order (AA)**: Focus moves in a logical sequence that preserves meaning and operability
* **2.4.7 Focus Visible (AA)**: Keyboard focus indicator is visible when components receive keyboard focus  
* **2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) (AA)**: When a component receives keyboard focus, it is not entirely hidden due to author-created content
* **3.2.3 Consistent Navigation (AA)**: Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated

### Form-specific requirements

* **1.3.1 Info and Relationships (AA)**: Form labels, instructions, and error messages must be programmatically associated with form fields
* **2.1.1 Keyboard (AA)**: All form functionality must be available from a keyboard
* **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (AA)**: Labels or instructions are provided when content requires user input
* **3.3.3 Error Suggestion (AA)**: If an input error is automatically detected, suggestions for correction are provided
* **3.3.4 Error Prevention (AA)**: For forms that cause legal commitments or financial transactions, submissions are reversible, verified, or confirmed
* **4.1.3 Status Messages (AA)**: Status messages (like form validation) can be programmatically determined

### Additional cognitive accessibility requirements

* **2.2.1 Timing Adjustable (AA)**: Time limits can be extended or disabled
* **3.2.2 On Input (AA)**: Changing form controls doesn't cause unexpected context changes
* **3.3.1 Error Identification (AA)**: If input errors are detected, the items in error are identified and described to users in text

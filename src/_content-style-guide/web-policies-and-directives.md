## VA Web Governance site

Be sure to visit [https://digital.va.gov/web-governance/](https://digital.va.gov/web-governance/) regularly. We update the governance site when federal regulations, VA policies, or standards change.

### Primary VA policies

__VA Directive 6102.__ The directive documents the policies for digital experiences, no matter where they’re hosted. The information in the directive applies to all organizations within VA.

__VA Handbook 6102.__ The handbook includes both federal and VA requirements for establishing and administering VA internet and intranet services. The handbook provides standards on how to implement the policies in the directive.

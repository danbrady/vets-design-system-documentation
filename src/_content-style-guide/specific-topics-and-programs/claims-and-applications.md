## Considerations

- We use the terms "claim" and "application" intentionally, and they often aren't interchangeable. We also use other related terms like "request" and "authorization" to refer to other types of VA forms.
- In reusable content that appears in many types of applications, requests, and static pages (like an alert), use the general term "form" instead of "claim," "application," or "request" to avoid confusion.  
Like this: "Thank you for submitting your form on VA.gov"  
Not this: "Thank you for submitting your application on VA.gov"
- Updated standards can take time to implement across all content on VA.gov pages and interactive forms and tools. Existing content on VA.gov, including the claims status tool, may not always reflect the latest decisions documented here. If you have questions about any content, feel free to ask the content and information architecture team.

**Note:** We're working on style guidance for additional types of VA forms and for how to refer to different people involved in submitting forms, like third-party representatives. Check back soon.

## Related terms

**application** (noun) and **apply** (verb)
: We use this term in the context of someone submitting an initial application for benefits. In general, a Veteran will "apply" for any non-disability benefit (including pension and DIC benefits) and "file a claim" for disability.

**claim** (noun) and **file a claim** (verb)
: In most cases we use this term in the context of someone filing a disability claim. We also use this term in the context of reimbursement and after someone applies for a benefit and has been judged eligible. For example, a Veteran may file a travel reimbursement claim or a life insurance claim. We use this term to reflect that Veterans who are filing for disability—or filing a claim for reimbursement—have a right to that compensation.

**claimant** and **applicant**
: We sometimes use this term to refer to the person with the claim or the person applying for the benefit—especially if the person isn't a Veteran, or if they aren't the person submitting the form (for example: "I'm signing for the claimant"). Always define the term on the first instance as "person with the claim" or "person applying for this benefit." When possible, use specific plain language instead, like "Veteran's spouse" or "Veteran's child." 

Like this: "I'm the spouse, dependent, survivor, or caregiver of a Veteran, and I have an existing claim."
Not this: "I'm a non-Veteran claimant."

**claim exam**
: We use claim exams to determine if a Veteran has a service-connected disability. We also use claim exams to rate that disability.
: - Note: This term is evolving. For now, on first mention on a page, use “VA claim exam (also known as a compensation and pension, or C&P, exam).” After first mention, use “VA claim exam” or “claim exam.”

**document**
: We use this term to refer to the digital or paper item a Veteran is submitting as evidence.
: - Note: File input screens in form flows should use "document" in the screen header. For example, "Upload your supporting documents."

**evidence**
: We use evidence to refer to all documents and information you submit to support your claim or application. We define evidence as “supporting documents or information.” Supporting documents and other information become evidence when they get attached to a claim or application.

**file** (noun)
: We use this term to refer to the actual file a Veteran is uploading from their device. These may be “documents” as in .doc—and could also be .pdf, .jpg, .png, or other file types.
: - Note: Button text on file upload screens should say "Upload file," not "Upload document" or "Upload evidence."

**request**
: We use this term to refer to a formal ask for something. This could be asking for a next step or further action on something—like requesting a decision review or clinical appeal. Or this could be asking for an item—like requesting a Presidential Memorial Certificate. When you submit a request on VA.gov, you usually don't need to explain why you're eligible in the request itself. This differs from applications, which often involve someone explaining or proving that they're eligible. We also use this term in the context of reimbursement for licensing and certification tests and the prep courses for those tests.

**sponsor** 
: We use this word in forms and other content to refer to the Veteran who earned the benefits that a family member may be using. It's OK to use the word sponsor if you lead with the plain language definition. 

Example: the Veteran you're connected to (called your "sponsor")

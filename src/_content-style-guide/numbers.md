## Use numerals

We use numerals, or figures, for all numbers, including 1 to 10. It's easier to scan on the web and mobile, and can be helpful to readers with lower literacy and people whose first language isn’t English.

When used as part of a series, date, or range, always default to numerals.

### Exceptions

- Spell out "one" when it's used in expressions like one-to-one, one-on-one, one-time, and "one of the reasons..." Use the numeral "1" for all other instances.
- Spell out ordinals up to tenth (first, second, third, etc.), unless it's part of a series or range. After "tenth," use: 11th, 12th, etc.

## Signs and symbols

We use certain symbols in content throughout VA.gov. Well-known signs and symbols can be easier to scan.

### Ampersand

Don’t use ampersands (&) in headers or body copy. Spell out “and.” The exception is if it’s part of a proper noun, such as a program name.

### Dollar sign

In general, use the dollar sign instead of spelling out "dollars."  

Add "$" to table cells so screenreaders read the number as dollars and cents and not as a standard decimal.

### Degree symbol

When pairing with a specific number, use the degree symbol. Don't add a space between the number and degree symbol or the degree symbol and F or C.

### Percent sign

Use numerals and the % symbol, with no space between the number and %. This style follows the practice for scientific and technical writing, and differs from 18F.

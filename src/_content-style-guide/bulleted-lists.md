intro-text: Bulleted and numbered lists help make information easier to scan and understand. If a sentence contains more than 3 items or ideas, we recommend breaking the sentence up into a list. These guidelines also apply to content for checkboxes and radio buttons in forms.

## Considerations

{% include content/unordered-list.md %}

## Punctuation

Here's how we determine whether to include ending punctuation for lists:

* If all items in a list are single sentences or sentence fragments, don't use ending periods for any list items (including the last item)
* If any list item contains 2 or more sentences, use ending periods for all items in the list (including any fragments)

**Note:** We determine punctuation by list, not by page. It's OK to have a list of fragments with no ending periods on the same page as a list of multiple full sentences with ending periods. Just use the correct house style of punctuation for each type of list.

### Example of bulleted list with fragments

Use parallel construction and don't use ending periods for fragments.

### Example of bulleted list with conjunctions

For complex eligibility criteria, we use the conjunctions “and” or “or” at the end of each individual requirement in the list to help make the relationship between the requirements clear. In these cases, use a comma before the conjunction and bold the “**and**” or “**or**” at the end of each bullet point. Always separate out lists of “**and**” and “**or**” requirements.

You may be eligible for VA disability benefits or compensation if you meet these requirements.

__Both of these descriptions must be true:__

- You have a current illness or injury (known as a condition) that affects your mind or body, **and**
- You served on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training

__And at least one of these descriptions must be true:__

- You got sick or injured while serving in the military—and can link this condition to your illness or injury (called an in-service disability claim), **or**
- You had an illness or injury before you joined the military—and serving made it worse (called a pre-service disability claim), **or**
- You have a disability related to your active-duty service that didn’t appear until after you ended your service (called a post-service disability claim)

### Example of bulleted list with more than one sentence

If any item in a bulleted list contains a fragment and 1 or more additional full sentences, use ending periods for all items in the list.

## Links in lists

-	List items can be links in certain situations. But we don’t want to overwhelm people with a long list of links, if possible.
-	Not all items in a list need to be a link. It’s okay to have only 1 or 2 items in a list linked.
-	If every item in a list is a link, keep the list short (less than 7 items). Every link should go to a different location—don’t link to the same page multiple times in the list.
-	When a list item is a link, the entire list item must be part of the link. Don’t link just 1 or 2 words.

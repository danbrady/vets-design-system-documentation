intro-text: Our house style guide for documentation on the VA Design System site.
---

This is our house style guide for the VA Design System (VADS). The basis of this guide is the VA.gov content style guide (VA-CSG), and the rules therein generally apply to the Design System. Instances where the Design System differs from the VA-CSG are documented here. 

## Using this Guide
For issues not covered in this style guide, refer to:

- [VA Content Style Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/)
- [AP Style](https://apstylebook.com/)
- [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)

## VADS-specific guidance

### Abbreviations and acronyms

While there are abbreviations and acronyms that we use extensively in the Design System, we should be careful to define these when they are first used on a page. This ensures that VADS pages can be used by both veteran and new VFS (Veteran-Facing Services) teams.

### Capitalization

Components, patterns, and template names should use title case. More details on naming components can be found in the [Referencing components, patterns, and templates](#referencing-components-patterns-and-templates) section of this document.

### Including "AKA" sections

Often, there are several colloquial names for a component, pattern, or template. For example, the [Search Input component]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/search-input) is often called a search box, search field, or search bar by users. When possible, include a section in the component guidance with a list of these other names. This helps users find what they’re looking for even if they’re familiar with a term that differs from the component name. 

### Links

In-line links are acceptable for linking to Components in the VA Design System. These links do not need to be on their own line.

### Plain language

VA.gov plain language standards still apply to VADS. However, there may be instances where communication with VA.gov product teams demands a higher level of expertise than the plain language standards account for. This is particularly likely in these areas: 

- [Use short sentences]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/plain-language/use-short-sentences)
- [Use simple words and terms]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/plain-language/use-simple-words-and-terms)
- [Define complex terms]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/plain-language/define-complex-terms)
- [Don’t use jargon]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/plain-language/don-t-use-jargon)

In these instances, prioritize effective communication over the letter of the law, keeping these best practices in mind: 

- It is better to include too much information than too little 
- Guidance should be accessible to both seasoned and new VA.gov product team members
- Link to other guidance when relevant or useful

### Referencing components, patterns, and templates

Component, pattern, and template names should be written in title case. 

When used in documentation, the component, pattern, or template name should be a hyperlink to the VADS guidance for that component, pattern, or template. 

These formatting conventions help readers to distinguish the difference between a more general tool and our specific VADS components (e.g., the difference between an accordion as a generic UI component and the VADS Accordion component). 

When referencing components, patterns, and templates with multi-step names in other documentation, use the full name. E.g., [Ask Users for A Single Response]({{ site.baseurl }}/patterns/ask-users-for/a-single-response).

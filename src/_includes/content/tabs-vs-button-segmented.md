### Choosing the right component for the task

When deciding which component to use, consider the data that will be displayed and the number of options required. 

#### Tabs

Use [Tabs](https://design.va.gov/components/tabs) to navigate between related content sections within the same hierarchy.

* Best for ~2-7 options that have unique URLS for each content section or tab.
* Examples that work well with the Tabs:
    * Tabs in Claim Status: "Details", "Documents", "Letters".
    * Tabs for Messaging:  "Inbox", "Sent", "Archived".

#### Button - Segmented

Use [Buttons - segmented](https://design.va.gov/components/button/button-segmented) to toggle display modes, filters, or sort modes of the same content.

* Best for 2-4 options of tightly related content.
* Examples that work well with the Button - Segmented:
    * Toggle between a "List" and "Grid".
    * Filter transactions by "30 days", "90 days", or "All".
    * Sort by "Oldest" or "Newest".

#### Sidenav

Use [Sidenav](https://design.va.gov/components/sidenav) to navigate between pages or major sections of the site with the same or different hierachies.

* Best for showing long lists of links or hierarchical navigation.
* Examples that work well with the Sidenav:
    * Profile sections like "Personal info", "Military info", etc.
    * [VA Benefits and Healthcare](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/)

#### What to avoid

* **Don't use too many tabs.** Limiting the number of tabs will provide a better experience on small screens.
* **Don't nest tabs urls within the Sidenav.** If using both the Sidenav and Tabs on the same page, avoid adding tab URLs to the Sidenav.

* **Introduce the list.** Introduce the list with a full sentence.
* **No single item lists.** Don't use an ordered or unordered (bulleted) list for only one item.
* **Avoid using sub-bullets.** Sub-bullets can make the content harder to scan. If possible, make the item with sub-bullets a separate list.<br>
  **Note:** Bulleted lists can be used in step-by-step lists.
* **Item content must be succinct.** Keep each item succinct for scannability (for example, 1 or 2 sentences each).  
* **Connect items appropriately.** When using "and" or "or" at the end of each bullet point, use a comma and bold the "and" or "or" at the end of each bullet point.<br>
  **Note:** Don't use "and/or" in lists. Instead, restructure the content to list all options (for example, "your income and/or net worth" should be "your income, your net worth, or both").
* **No more than 7 items without a break.** If your list has more than 7 items, use subheads to break out the list into smaller bullet lists.
* **Use parallel construction within a list.** Each list item should be consistent. For example, starting with a verb or noun phrase.

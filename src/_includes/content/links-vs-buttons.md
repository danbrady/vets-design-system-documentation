### Links vs. buttons

- Using links and buttons intentionally results in a more inclusive experience for assistive technology users. Make sure to read both [buttons]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/button) and [Action Link]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/link/action) guidance to determine when you should use each component.
- It is important to use Action Links for calls to actions that link to another page rather than buttons, because screen readers always say “link” before links, and “button” before buttons. 
- A good rule is if the action changes the URL, it should not be a button.
- Button and link confusion can be very frustrating for assistive technology users. A user with a screen reader may pull up a list of links and may not find a specific link because it turns out that it’s been designated as a button in the markup.
- When a file download is involved, it is best to use the [download link](https://design.va.gov/components/link/#download) component. This is because links are intended for navigation, and downloading a file is a navigational action to a resource.

* When a user dismisses an alert, it disappears from the page structure. If a keyboard or screen reader user closes the alert, they will lose focus and in some browsers, this can return the user to the top of the page. To fix this, teams must manage focus after an alert is dismissed. Focus should shift to the next suitable spot on the page. This will vary based on the page's purpose and the user's next required action. Good starting points to consider would be the next heading after the alert or the `h1` on the page.

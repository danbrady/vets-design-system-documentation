## What is Information Architecture?

Information Architecture (IA) is the structural design of shared information environments. It involves organizing, structuring, and labeling content in an effective and sustainable way to help users find information and complete tasks.

## IA Principles

Good information architecture follows these key principles:

### 1. User-Centered Design
- Structure content based on user needs and mental models
- Conduct user research to understand how people categorize and search for information
- Test navigation and content organization with real users

### 2. Clear Hierarchy
- Create logical groupings and categories
- Use consistent labeling and terminology
- Establish clear parent-child relationships between content

### 3. Findability
- Make content discoverable through multiple pathways
- Implement effective search functionality
- Use descriptive headings and metadata

### 4. Consistency
- Apply consistent patterns across the entire system
- Use standardized navigation elements
- Maintain consistent terminology and content structure

### 5. Scalability
- Design systems that can grow and evolve
- Create flexible structures that accommodate new content
- Plan for future expansion and changes

> [!TIP]  
> A preview environment is automatically created and updated with every PR (including draft PRs).
>
> Once you've committed, we run some automated checks and generate this preview environment, so it takes a minute or two.
>
> The URL of this preview environment follows this format:
>
> `https://dev-design.va.gov/[This_PR_number]`
>
> Eventually you will see an entry in the timeline similar to this:
>   
>  > [Your Username] deployed to development [X time] ago - with Github Actions [View Deployment]
> 
> Clicking the "View Deployment" button will open a browser window to preview your changes as they will appear after being merged.
>   
> **Note:** The preview environment only works for PRs submitted to the official repository. It will not work for forked repositories.

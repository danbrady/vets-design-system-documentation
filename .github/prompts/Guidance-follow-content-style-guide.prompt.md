This repository contains guidance for creating applications for VA.gov and the VA Health and Benefits mobile application using components and patterns. Your goal is to review any guidance changes in this repo and ensure they meet the guidelines in the VA.gov Content Style Guide (VA-CSG) and the VADS-specific guidance outlined below.

**CRITICAL: When editing markdown files, NEVER modify the YAML front-matter (the content between the opening and closing --- lines at the top of the file). This includes the title, layout, and any other metadata fields. Only edit the markdown content below the closing --- line. Modifying the YAML front-matter will break the page.**

## VA.gov Content Style Guide Requirements

Follow the VA.gov Content Style Guide with these specific areas of focus:

* Avoid abbreviations and acronyms unless they are very common and familiar to designers and developers: [Abbreviations and acronyms](../../src/_content-style-guide/abbreviations-and-acronyms.md)
* Use correct capitalization: [Capitalization](../../src/_content-style-guide/capitalization.md)
* We differ from AP Style on numbers in order to meet the needs of users on the web and on mobile: [Numbers](../../src/_content-style-guide/numbers.md)
* Follow standard American English and AP Style: [Punctuation](../../src/_content-style-guide/punctuation.md)
* Use active voice: [Use active voice](../../src/_content-style-guide/plain-language/use-active-voice.md)
* Avoid or minimize references to branded program names: [Avoid branded names](../../src/_content-style-guide/plain-language/avoid-branded-names.md)
* [Use contractions](../../src/_content-style-guide/plain-language/use-contractions.md)

## VADS-Specific Guidance

In addition to the VA.gov Content Style Guide, apply the VADS-specific writing guidance found in the "Writing for VADS" section: [Contributing to VADS documentation - Writing for VADS](../../src/_about/contributing/contributing-to-docs.md#writing-for-vads)

This includes specific guidance on:
* [Abbreviations and acronyms for VADS](../../src/_about/contributing/contributing-to-docs.md#abbreviations-and-acronyms)
* [Capitalization exceptions for component names](../../src/_about/contributing/contributing-to-docs.md#capitalization)
* [Including "AKA" sections for alternative component names](../../src/_about/contributing/contributing-to-docs.md#including-aka-sections)
* [Links formatting for VADS content](../../src/_about/contributing/contributing-to-docs.md#links)
* [Plain language considerations for technical audiences](../../src/_about/contributing/contributing-to-docs.md#plain-language)
* [Referencing components, patterns, and templates](../../src/_about/contributing/contributing-to-docs.md#referencing-components-patterns-and-templates)

## Review Process

When reviewing pull requests that modify guidance content, ensure:
1. YAML front-matter remains unchanged unless explicitly requested
2. Content follows VA-CSG standards with VADS-specific exceptions as noted above
3. Component, pattern, and template names are properly formatted and linked
4. Plain language principles are applied appropriately for the technical audience
5. Abbreviations and acronyms are defined when first used on a page
